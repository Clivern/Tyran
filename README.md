`Tyran` is a vector search as a service, designed to efficiently retrieve relevant context for large language models (`LLMs`). `Tyran` organizes documents alongside their associated metadata, such as topic, project or team, to enhance the search process.


## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed for the quick start.


To run `Tyran` with `sqlite` and `qdrant` on port `8000` on docker.

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clivern/Tyran/main/docker-compose-sqlite.yml \
    -O docker-compose.yml

$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=~~key goes here~~

$ docker-compose up -d
```

To run `Tyran` with `mysql` and `qdrant` on port `8000` on docker.

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clivern/Tyran/main/docker-compose-mysql.yml \
    -O docker-compose.yml

$ export DB_USERNAME=tyran
$ export DB_PASSWORD=D1q9f0C2PEW
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=~~key goes here~~

$ docker-compose up -d
```

To test the setup, create a simple document and then query it.

```bash
$ curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/document \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content": "Hello World", "metadata": {"type":"testdata"}}'

{
  "id": "3d0ffff3-5d05-46e3-84c3-b805aad93a81",
  "content": "Hello World",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "testdata"
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-09-06T11:16:00",
  "updatedAt": "2024-09-06T11:16:00"
}

$ curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/document/search \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "hi world", "limit": 1, "metadata": {"type":"testdata"}}'
